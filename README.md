# Medicare-Health-Care-Case-Study-_Cloudera-Data-Science-Challenge

### BUSINESS CONTEXT: 
The Cloudera Data Science Challenge is a rigorous competition in which candidates must  provide a solution to a real-world big data problem that surpasses a benchmark specified by  some of the world's elite data scientists.  
In the U.S., Medicare reimburses private providers for medical procedures performed for  covered individuals. As such, it needs to verify that the type of procedures performed and  the cost of those procedures are consistent and reasonable. Finally, it needs to detect  possible errors or fraud in claims for reimbursement from providers. You have been hired to  analyze a large amount of data from Medicare and try to detect abnormal data -- providers,  areas, or patients with unusual procedures and/or claims. 
The objective of the Cloudera Data Science Challenge 2 was to uncover anomalous patients,  procedures, providers, and regions in the United States government’s Medicare health  insurance system. 

### PROBLEM SUMMARY: 
The Challenge was divided into the following three parts, each of which had specific  requirements that pertained to identifying anomalous entities in different aspects of the  Medicare system:  
Part 1: Identify providers that overcharge for certain procedures or regions where  procedures are too expensive.  
Part 1A: Highest Cost Variation 
Parts 1B: Highest-Cost Claims by Provider  
Parts 1C: Highest-Cost Claims by Region 
Part 1D: Highest Number of Procedures and Largest Differences between Claims and  Reimbursements 

Part 2: Identify the three providers that are least similar to other providers and the three  regions that are least similar to other regions.  
Part 2A: Providers Least Like Others  
Part 2B: Regions Least Like Others 
Part 3: Identify 10,000 Medicare patients who are involved in anomalous activities.  DATA AVAILABLE: 
Completing the different parts of the Challenge required using several data sources.

Parts 1 and 2 were based on financial summary data from 2011 that were made available by  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in both comma-separated values  (CSV) formats.  
⮚ Medicare_Charge_Inpatient_DRG100_DRG_Summary_by_DRG_FY2011.csv ⮚ Medicare_Charge_Outpatient_APC30_Summary_by_APC_CY2011.csv ⮚ Medicare_Provider_Charge_Inpatient_DRG100_FY2011.csv 

⮚ Medicare_Provider_Charge_Outpatient_APC30_CY2011_v2.csv 
You can also find these details from the below links. 

Part 3 of the Challenge required patient demographic information and patient-procedure  transaction information 
⮚ Patient_history_samp.csv 
⮚ Review_patient_history_samp.csv 
⮚ Rreview_transaction_coo.csv 
⮚ Transaction_coo.csv 

Expectations: 
Import the data into statistical softwares and perform a variety of data  preprocessing, analysis, and visualization using different techniques. 

Note: Part 3 not performed as the data wasn't available.
